<h1>Dart: primeiros passos com a linguagem</h1>
<br>
<p> Projects developed during Alura's HTML and CSS course. During four modules, four projects were developed from the same site, exponentially evolving the quality and techniques in the code.
 <br>
Finally, after deepening the development with the two technologies mentioned above, a final project was developed, using the latest in the WEB aspect. The final Site has three main tabs (Index(home), Products and Contact). In addition, the site has the Bootstrap framework for creating animations and visual improvements on the page.
