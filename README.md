Dart is an open source language developed in Google with the aim of allowing developers to use an object-oriented language with static type analysis. Since the first stable release in 2011, Dart has changed quite a bit, both in the language itself and in its primary goals. With version 2.0, Dart's type system went from optional to static, and since its arrival, Flutter (we'll explain later) has become the main target of the language.
